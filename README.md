# refined-bitbucket-server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joancaron/refined-bitbucket-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joancaron/refined-bitbucket-server)

### Launch the dev env

Install yarn using the .msi (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)

Once cloned, you can open the code in your favorite editor. You will need to run those commands to work efficiently :

- `yarn` : will install the dependencies required by the project
- `yarn watch` : will start a webpack dev server with hot module reload to rebuild the extension on source change
